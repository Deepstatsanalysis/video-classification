\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This research report summarises our experiences and experiments for activity recognition in videos using the deep neural network framework Caffe \cite{jia2014caffe}.

Section~\ref{sec:related} lists and summarises the papers we built on.
We also talk about our problems reproducing some of their results.
Section~\ref{sec:data} shows the details of our data preprocessing.
Section~\ref{sec:classification} explains our net architectures and shows the results of some experiments.
Section~\ref{sec:web} focuses on the web application, and finally section~\ref{sec:scripts} summarises the scripts we used and 

\subsection{Research Task}
The goal of this research project is to apply state of the art deep neural network to activity recognition for videos. We aim to confirm the outstanding classification performance of a two-stream learning architecture\cite{simonyan2014two} as proposed by Simonyan et al. More specifically, we focus on validating the top of the class prediction results of 91.3\% as presented by Wu et al.\cite{wu2015modeling}.
