\label{sec:classificaton}

\subsection{Changes to Caffe-tmbo}

\begin{itemize}
	\item New sequence data layer
	\item Multi-layer script
	\item More?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spatial}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Different nets:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Caffenet/CNN\_M (also tried, VGG 19 and 16, but too big)
			\item With weights/without weights
			\item Compare the nets with respect to memory, number of parameters, training time, performance
		\end{itemize}
	\item
		Experiments:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Different dropouts
			\item Train from scratch vs train from weights
			\item On different splits?
			\item Fc6, Fc7, fc8
			\item Different base data sets (only 16, all data)
			\item Different flows?
			\item Occlusion tests
		\end{itemize}
	\item
		LSTM did not work out
\end{itemize}
