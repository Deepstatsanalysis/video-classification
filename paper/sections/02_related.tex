\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain the development in the last two years and their respective approaches
    \item Explain LSTM
	\item Explain, why some papers are hard to reproduce
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reproducibility Issues}
Understanding and recreating some papers are a challenge in its own right. Certain claims and results were hard to reproduce. In most cases the network architecture is very well published and most nets are available to research community for download. However, data generation varies between labs and is not described in detail.
Concretely, we are missing information on the following parameters organized by paper:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which frame rate was used to extract frames from videos
	\item When frames are sampled from the video, which selection schema was used?
	\item
	\item IDEA: Use a table and list which paper lists which preprocessing steps?
	\item TODO
\end{itemize}
