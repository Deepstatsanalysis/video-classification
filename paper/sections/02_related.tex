\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain the development in the last two years and their respective approaches
	\item Explain, why some papers are hard to reproduce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducability Issues}
Some papers were hard to reproduce, because the data generation was not described in detail.
Concretely, these are parameters, which were not mentioned (neither in the paper nor on the web page) for some approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which frame rate was used to extract frames from videos
	\item When frames are sampled from the video, which selection schema was used?
	\item 
	\item IDEA: Use a table and list which paper lists which preprocessing steps?
	\item TODO
\end{itemize}
